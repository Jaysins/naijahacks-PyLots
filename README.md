Problem
The problem we observed are in the pre harvest and post harvest stage .For the pre harvest, inaccessibility to funds from financial organization and improved technologies like improved cultivars, seedlings, tissue culture,  fertilizer, pesticides e.t.c. whereas the post harvest is lack of storage facilities and access to wide range of market (national and international).

Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is the creation of a platform using Python, Bootstrap e.t.c. that will connect farmers to financial organization that give funds, biotech companies that provide technologies like improved cultivars, seedlings, Storage facilities within their location and national and international market. The solution been provided will fasten the process of information getting to farmers, help in alienating the traditional way of doing this things and create more awareness to a wide range of farmers in a country ranging from the interior locality to urban.
